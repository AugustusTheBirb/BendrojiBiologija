1. **Cells**
	- smallest units of life
	- new cells can only be made from existing cells ([[abiogenesis]])
2. **Living organisms use energy**
	- Breathing - the chemical reactions that create energy
	- Metabolism - umbrella term for the cycle of creating and using energy in an organism
3. **Organisms interact with the environment**
	- survive, gather resources etc.
4. **Keep Homeostasis**
	- Constant internal pressure, temp., pH and so on.
	- pronounced effect on the cell scale (small window of accepted values)
	- organisms can tolerate larger deviations
5. **Living organisms grow and reproduce**
6. **[Genetic material](DNA.md)  allows reproduction**
7. **Organisms evolve**
	- long term process for most animals due to long generations
	- not fruit flies though they're very fast so often studied
8. **All species are linked via [evolutionary history](Evolution.md)**
	- All organisms share a common ancestor
10. **Structure determines function**
	- This holds true at every level of granularity - molecule, tissue, organ, organism
11. **New features arise from complicated interactions**
12. **Biology is a experimental science**
	- [[Biology as a scientific discipline]]
13. **Biology affects our society**
