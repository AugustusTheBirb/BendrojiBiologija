## Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes

### Prokaryotes: 
- Simple cells
- No nucleus
- Bacteria and Archaea
	- Small cells
	- Bacteria - widely found, mostly harmless
	- Archaea - rare, extremophiles,  different membrane structure and their proteins are highly resilient to pH and temp. changes
Typical cell: 
- plazminė membrane
- Cytoplasm
- Nucleoid
- Ribosomes

Many structures are located outside the membrane
- Cell wall - safety and structure
- Glikokaliksas - sulaiko vandeni, apsaugo
- Galūnės - pilės (prisitvirtinimui), žiuželis (judėjimui)

### Eukaryotes:
- DNA is in the nucleus
- Compartmentalization
- Organelle - a region of cell with a membrane and a function.

oh god oh fuck there's so much stuff

## Three domains:
#### Bacteria
Mostly unicellular prokaryotes that inhabit many diverse environments on Earth.
#### Archaea
Unicellular prokaryotes that often live in extreme environments, such as hot springs.

^ both are prokaryotes
no nucleus  L bozos

#### Eukaryotes
* Protista
	* Can move but only as simple responses to stimuli
* Plants
	* Have a some nervous system, can move
* Animals
	* Can photosynthesize
* Mushrooms
	* are real fungi-s
