- [[Amino acid]] polymers
- Amino acids join via peptide bonds to make polypeptides
- Proteins consist of 1 or more polypeptide chains
- Break down via hydrolysis
---
### Protein structures are separated into 4 levels
#### **Pirminė** - amino acid chain - polypeptide, determined by genes
#### **Antrinė** - repeated structures like **alpha helices** and **beta sheets** form because of polar and non-polar attraction, also areas of "random structure" which are neither $\alpha$ nor $\beta$ yet still very important for function of the protein

#### **Tretinė** - folding - determines complex 3d structure, the final step if the protein consists of 1 polypeptide chain
#### **Ketvirtinė** - 2 or more polypeptides - the whole protein with all polypeptides chains incorporated (multimeric protein)

### 5 Key factors affecting folding and stability
1. Hydrogen bonds
2. Ionic bonds and other polar interactions
3. Hydrophobic effects
4. Van der Walls forces
5. Disulphide bonds

Proteins often interact with each other, the interaction happens on a specific surface of the protein determined by the first four key factors
[[Membranes]]
Transport proteins
- Transmembrane proteins allow diffusion through membranes
- Channels
	- Creates a way for diffusion, are controlled, allow water
- Carriers
	- Conformational changes transport things. 
	- Main way for organics to enter the cell
		- Uniporter - one mol. one dir. 
		- Symporter,  >1 mol. one dir.
		- Antiporter any mol. any dir.
- **Active**
	- against gradient, needs ATP
	- Primary uses siurbliai simple dimple
	- Secondary uses one molecule for which the concentration gradient is favorable to transport another for which it isn't
